# Predictive-Analysis-for-telecom-Customer-Churn-
client churn is a major issue in the telecom sector, influencing both revenue and client retention methods. The goal of this research is to use machine learning to analyse, predict, and minimise telecom customer turnover. We use real-world data to discover major variables impacting churn and construct prediction models that assist telecom firms take preventive steps.
Technology stack includes Python programming language and libraries. Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn Machine Learning. Models include logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1.EDA is critical to understanding consumer behaviour. Key findings include:
2.Identifying the turnover rate distribution.
3.Analyse contract kinds, payment methods, and service consumption.
4.Correlation of features and customer turnover

### Machine Learning:
Data Preprocessing-
Handling Missing Values
Encoding categorical variables.
Feature scaling, model training, and evaluation.

Train several models to anticipate churn.
Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Results and Insights
Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to leave.
Senior individuals and those with high monthly expenses experience greater churn rates.
Automatic payment mechanisms minimise churn when compared to manual payments.

### Conclusion
This initiative delivers significant insights on telecom customer behaviour, enabling businesses to minimise churn and enhance customer retention strategies through data-driven decision-making.
